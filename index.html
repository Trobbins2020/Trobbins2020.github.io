      <h1>Intro</h1>

      <p>My name is Talon Y. Robbins.</p>
      <p>I am a JavaScript programmer in training! As a Software Engineering Student at Thinkful, I am honing my skills and building my portfolio.</p>

      <article id="about">
      <h1>About</h1> 
        <p>I am originally from Des Moines, Iowa before moving to Austin, Texas to pursue a career in Acting and learn computer programming.</p>
        <p>I have always seen myself with a future in Computer Technology. Ever since my first experience with Computers when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have learned Troubleshooting for Phones, Computers and Gaming Systems. I have taught myself HTML when I was 12-16 years old (On and Off using W3Schools).
           My family and loved ones are my biggest motivation. I have a burning desire to be a financial resource for them when they are in need. Like most fathers and lovers, I want to have the financial stability to take care of both my daughter and significant other/lover in every way possible.
          Thinkful will give me the opportunity to gain the skills I need to achieve these goals in a timely fashion, and follow the path I believe destiny has laid out for me. It is what personally drives me to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>I am ready and willing to work either alone or with a team to meet goals!</p>
